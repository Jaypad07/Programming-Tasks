Implement the Runnable interface in the Pharmacy and Person classes.
All threads should run until isStopped is true.
Here&#39;s the logic for the Pharmacy class: drugController should make a random sale (call the void sell(Drug drug, int count) method) of a random drug (getRandomDrug) in a random amount (getRandomCount) and wait 300 ms.
Here&#39;s the logic for the Person class: drugController should make a random purchase (call the void buy(Drug drug, int count) method) of a random drug (getRandomDrug) in a random amount (getRandomCount) and wait 100 ms.
Put the synchronized keyword where necessary.
